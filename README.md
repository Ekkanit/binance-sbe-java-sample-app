# SBE Java Sample Application

This sample application is designed to decode `exchangeInfo` endpoint's response to YAML, when using the [Binance Spot API Simple Binary Encoding (SBE)](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/faqs/sbe_faq.md).

Moreover, there are additional decoder classes that can be useful for decoding SBE responses from other endpoints in the Binance Spot API.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the source code to your local end.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:binance/binance-sbe-java-sample-app
```

2. Navigate to the directory where `pom.xml` file is located and build the project with `Maven` to generate `./target/sbe-sample-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

```shell
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

The following commands use `./target/sbe-sample-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to output on STDOUT the `exchangeInfo` SBE response in YAML.

### Via reading SBE-encoded HTTP response from STDIN

```shell
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/sbe' -H 'X-MBX-SBE: 1:0' 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/exchangeInfo' | java -jar ./target/sbe-sample-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -
```

### Via reading SBE-encoded WebSocket response from STDIN

```shell
echo '{"id":"93fb61ef-89f8-4d6e-b022-4f035a3fadad","method":"exchangeInfo","params":{}}' | ./tools/websocket_send.py  'wss://ws-api.binance.com:443/ws-api/v3?responseFormat=sbe&sbeSchemaId=1&sbeSchemaVersion=0' | java -jar ./target/sbe-sample-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -
```

Note: To run `websocket_send.py`, your Python 3 environment should include the `websocket-client` package with the integrated `create_connection` function.

### Via downloading SBE-encoded HTTP response within the app

```shell
java -jar ./target/sbe-sample-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/exchangeInfo'
```

The `spot_sbe` directory contains the decoder classes, which you can consult to explore other endpoints.

### Testnet 
To use the Spot Testnet API, you only need to replace:
- `api.binance.com` with `testnet.binance.vision` for the REST API
- `ws-api.binance.com` with `testnet.binance.vision` for the WebSocket API

## Update

### Java decoders

The `src/main/java/spot_sbe` directory contains code generated by [simple-binary-encoding](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding), which you will likely want to reuse verbatim. However, if you would like to update it, please navigate to the root of this project and follow these steps:

1) Download the [spot_prod_latest.xml](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/sbe/schemas/spot_prod_latest.xml) schema file to `src/main/resources`:
```shell
mkdir -p src/main/resources
cd src/main/resources
curl -o spot_latest.xml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/master/sbe/schemas/$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/master/sbe/schemas/spot_prod_latest.xml)
cd -
```

**Note:** If you are using the Spot Testnet API, replace `spot_prod_latest.xml` with `spot_testnet_latest.xml` in the above `curl ` command.

2) Clone & build [simple-binary-encoding](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding.git --branch '1.30.0'
cd simple-binary-encoding
./gradlew
cd ..
```

3) Run the SBE tool code generator built in the previous step:
```shell
java \
  -Dsbe.output.dir=src/main/java/ \
  -Dsbe.target.language=Java \
  -jar simple-binary-encoding/sbe-all/build/libs/sbe-all-1.30.0.jar \
  src/main/resources/spot_latest.xml
```

4) Remove unneeded encoder files:
```shell
find src/main/java/spot_sbe -type f -name '*Encoder.java' -exec rm '{}' \;
```
